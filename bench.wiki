== Wooden Bench ==
This story is somewhat similar to

I set out to take a ten minute break. I noticed some wood on the ground. I
thought about how my current desk could really benefit from a low seet. I felt
worried if the wood sat out much longer than it would be thrown away. 

But I needed a way to cut the wood. So I went and set up a saw. 
Saw ended up breaking. Luckily after I cut the pieces I need. 

Already 45 minutes into the 10 minute break, I'm now worrying about how to
fashion the pieces together. 

I finished the bench about 3 hours later. I guess there is no such thing as
quickly buildng a bench. 

I should remember this when in the midst of one task and thinking about taking
on another task.

I actually use this bench.
