Yush was yelled at by the neighbor. I failed in comforting her by trying to use
logic and advice.

11:29pm and I am getting my start. Had to set up the router. Last day with Luna.
Listened to a talk about asking questions.

Cleaned the house. Starting work at 10:37. I want to journal everyday this week
and ideally transition away from complice. I more or less have understood the
method and think I can implement it myself using the terminal. Each day
you just need to consider for each goal (is it enough/not enough).
</p>

<p>
For a while I would say don't use a template. just manually write it. Later
after deciding on a format you like you can easily make a template. So vimwiki
diary can become my new goal setting enviorment. 
</p>

<p>
For example for your is it enough template it could simply be.....
<span id="September-9/9-Wednesday-p"></span><span class="tag" id="p">p</span>
<span id="September-9/9-Wednesday-i"></span><span class="tag" id="i">i</span>
<span id="September-9/9-Wednesday-c"></span><span class="tag" id="c">c</span>
<span id="September-9/9-Wednesday-ma"></span><span class="tag" id="ma">ma</span>
<span id="September-9/9-Wednesday-r"></span><span class="tag" id="r">r</span>
<span id="September-9/9-Wednesday-pi"></span><span class="tag" id="pi">pi</span>
</p>

<p>
try using supermemo plan for deciding on and describing your day to day tasks
and how much time you want to spend on them. use the same abreviations is
superemo.

The days keep getting away from me. This time I want to try using only quire to
prioritize tasks. Daily tasks should take care of themselves. Is a schedule
really neccessary? If you have some time work. get work done. 
use quire to guide you on what work you should be doing. you can also 
reflect inside quire on how its going.

<p>
Not productive. But did prioritize meditation. Didint give into lust this week.
My weeks prior to that were rough. But this week my goal is to stay more
balanced.

<p>
Had trouble with the morning routine. I think it sort of shifted. I tihnk you
need to really hammer down that first magical hour.
</p>

<p>
My tools
</p>
<ul>
<li>
PLAN (how much time do I have today and how to allocate it)

<li>
QUIRE (what projects am I working on)

<li>
VIM (journaling and just writting. No rules basically. just get thoughts down
  without too much resisitnace. encourage good questions and thinking)

</ul>

I think the problem is not with your tools its just a little laziness and lack
of priority and ability to stick to plan. i mean come on you were doing Canjie.
its not worth a minute of your time. you have much more important matters to
take care of before learnning another stupid keyboard. 
</p>

<p>
you claim vim saved you so much time and dvorak. but i doubt it. i think it
cost you big time and distracted you from just doing. 
</p>

<p>
anyway lesson to learn is to focus on what you know really matters.

The day got away from me. I spent time on piano and helped Yush with her
project. In the morning we had a meditation retreat. I want to remember what
Ajan lee said about being crazy about meditation and take that into my approach
for living life. Ajan also said that we need to take breaks. That encouraged me.

<p>
I know texting is not skillfull. I fill a pull in that direction but I think in
order to get over this you have to dig into what is this pull? is it really that
satisfying?

I'm really sick of game of thrones because it is making me stay up late
listenieg to it. It's ultimately trash. Cheap entertainment. I felt better
reading my teacher's book. But then I started searhing for the perfect
meditation night time talk. Tonight I will use the other phone (old phone) then
I will put a hypnosis tape (pre loaded) onto the phone. 
</p>

<p>
Today Grandma comes home. Spent the first few moments of my day cleaning as my
morning workout. I think this is a good practice but maybe in the future you
should cap it at 20 minutes. Today I want to prioritize Chinese since I am
taking a class in that and I am tired of staying up late trying to cram it in.
There is no way I will stay up late for ios or my other hobbies so it seems
logical to complete the chinese first. Thats also a major task out of your day
once completed. 
</p>

<p>
I have to say, I think this journaling in vim wiki is really the right call.

<span id="September-9/15-Wednesday-p"></span><span class="tag" id="p">p</span> not that focused. probably because I got up late. wish I had gotten up at 6.

Today I want to make sure I stick to my PMO abstain routine. So i will eat but
still stick to 6pm and earlier rule. My main meal is at lunch. Sleeping would
probably be less risky to sleep in your own room because last night was really
risky. I think don't start more chinese tv let yush watch conan on her own time
because you need to prioritize your class.

Would be nice if you hand your chinese questions translated to traditional
before going to class.

doesnt feel relaxing. i need a new routine.

<p>
I feel really tired now. I want to prioritize sleep tonight by getting to my
room by 9pm. I've got a headache and I want to try tommorow a little harder to
do my cards earlier in the day. get a lot done before noon is the motto.
</p>

It is hard to let go. Yeah I get that. But its 847 and I am grateful to myself
