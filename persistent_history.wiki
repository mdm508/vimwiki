== Questions ==
1. How,where and when should the widget setup persistent history?
2. Is it required for the main app to communicate to the widget that it needs to
   refresh? Or will the widget refresh on its own whenever PS changes.
3. Suppose the widget does get notified about a change...how does it know a)
   what word to render b) if it even needs to render.
4. Currently I only care if the user presses the button that the widget updates.
   So, can i basically ignore the schedule
