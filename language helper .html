<p>
I love learning languages from videos...but i am dissatisfied with the available
tools on the market. 
</p>

<div id="Language helper-Whats your real goal?"><h2 id="Whats your real goal?" class="header"><a href="#Language helper-Whats your real goal?">Whats your real goal?</a></h2></div>
<p>
Well the only reason I want a tool like <a href="idea_trans_subs .html">transcribe substitles</a> is because I am tired of the
limitations of tools like migaku or language reactor  where you need soft subs to <a href="sentence_mining.html">sentence mine</a>
Such tools are also limited to specific platforms like youtube or netflix. You
need to write plugins for any video source. 
</p>

<p>
Besides that, the subs often don't match what the speaker is saying, which can
be difficult if your new to the language.
</p>

<p>
I'd love it if you could 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
accurately match what the speaker was saying

<li>
for any video that you can run on your computer

<li>
have ai give explanations and suggestions based on the entire context of what
   it has learned from the video.

</ol>
<div id="Language helper-Real time rather than all at once"><h2 id="Real time rather than all at once" class="header"><a href="#Language helper-Real time rather than all at once">Real time rather than all at once</a></h2></div>
<p>
I want to have a tool thats use as needed. Each translation will also be
expensive in terms of the AI analyzing it. This might be okay for learners who
plan to spend a long time reading a single subtitle anyway. 
</p>

<div id="Language helper-Windows"><h2 id="Windows" class="header"><a href="#Language helper-Windows">Windows</a></h2></div>
<p>
How much of the video should the AI take into consideration when providing
suggestions?
