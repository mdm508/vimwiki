= Random Memories =
I hope that by writting down these memories I can let some of them go. I am
pestered by them usually following some prompt.

== Coffee & Milk ==
In a class on basic logic the teacher talked about inclusive or. $P \lor Q$
He mentioned something along the lines of different ways that are sufficent for
your coffee to be mixed. P=you stirred it with a spoon Q=you poured milk in
before you poured in the coffee. If either or both were true then the whole
statement of your coffee being mixed would be true. Every time I mix coffee with
milk I am haunted by this random memory. 

== Tuesday/Thursday Confusion == 
An embarassing memory from that same logic class was when I asked the dumbest
question of my life. The teacher showed the calendar days on the slide as

M,T,W,T,F,S,S

And despite already knowing the answer I raised my hand and asked what the
second 'T' stood for. I'm not sure what my intention was behind this question.
