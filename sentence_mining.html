<p>
A language learning technique where you 'mine' for interesting sentences that
are appropriate for your level. You save them somewhere to review later. The
sentences are mined from a larger body of work that contains many sentences you
either don't care about or are too difficult. The idea is to mine the ones that
are good for you.
