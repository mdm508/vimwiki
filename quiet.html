Something I need more of

It is my fault. I sabatoge my own quiet time with constant
</p>
<ul>
<li>
podcasts

<li>
music

<li>
tv

<li>
chatting online

<li>
radio

</ul>
<div id="Can you hear the crickets?"><h2 id="Can you hear the crickets?" class="header"><a href="#Can you hear the crickets?">Can you hear the crickets?</a></h2></div>
<p>
My mind is so loud that even on a quiet night I sometimes fail to notice the
crickets singing. 
</p>

<div id="Are you scared of the quiet?"><h2 id="Are you scared of the quiet?" class="header"><a href="#Are you scared of the quiet?">Are you scared of the quiet?</a></h2></div>
<p>
I think so. I can't remember when, but at somepoint I started listening to audio
books at night to 'help me' fall asleep. God forbid I lay there for a few
moments without any input.
Maybe I'm scared of being swallowed up by the silence. Or maybe I have created a
bad association between being lonely and being quiet. 
</p>

<p>
I'm also scared that if I have quiet time then I will have more ability to hear
my thoughts and feelings. There is a part of me that doesn't want to deal with
those thoughts and feelings so I try to continuously drown them out.
</p>

<div id="How's that working for you?"><h2 id="How's that working for you?" class="header"><a href="#How's that working for you?">How's that working for you?</a></h2></div>
<p>
The thoughts and feelings creep back in anyway. And when the quiet finally does comes they come
rush in like a flood. 
</p>

<div id="What are you going to do about it?"><h2 id="What are you going to do about it?" class="header"><a href="#What are you going to do about it?">What are you going to do about it?</a></h2></div>
<p>
I want to try to do more activities, that I usually would 'pair' with some form
of background noise, silently.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Sleeping quietly. Maybe a short calming 15-20 minute talk to steer your
   thoughts in the right direction, but no more indefinite nonstop audio.

<li>
Studying quietly. Lofi sucks anyway. And let's face it, listening to chinese
   audio in the background is doing nothing to improve your language ability. 

<li>
Eating quietly. Stop watching tv while your eating. Eating is actually
   keeping you alive. You should pay attention to behaviors that are keeping you
   alive.

<li>
Walking quietly. Leave the podcast at home.

<li>
Driving quietly. Stop trying to 'optimize' your time by sqeezing in more
   information. <a href="do-one-thing.html">do-one-thing</a>

<li>
Resting quietly. Even my rest has become invaded. Taking a break often
   consists of me whipping out the phone or watching some dumb video. How about
   just sitting there? Or if you want to have a cup of tea then really enjoy
   that cup of tea. A cup of tea is rare.

</ol>

<p>
I want to become friends again with quiet. 
</p>

<div id="Space to think"><h2 id="Space to think" class="header"><a href="#Space to think">Space to think</a></h2></div>
<p>
when it quites down you have space to think your own thoughts. you give more priority to your own voice.
if all you do is consume you just become a parrot. its better to consume less and actually develop
your own thoughts and opinions on the things you do consume.
</p>

<p>
somewhat ironically i thought of this while taking a walk and not listening to anything.
