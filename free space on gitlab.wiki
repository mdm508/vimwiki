Every once and a while my Supermemo collection gets to big and I have to delete
my git history. Here is how to do that safely. 

{{{

git checkout --orphan new-branch
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -D main  # or master
git branch -m main  # or master
git push -f origin main  # or master

}}}

What is happening here is we make a temporary branch of most recent commit.
Delete the old branch which contains history. then make the temp branch our main
branch.

the key command to making the temporary branch is

`git checkout --orphan new-branch` which makes a new branch without any commit
history.
