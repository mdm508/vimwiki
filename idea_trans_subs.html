<p>
Objective: Take videos and write their subtitles in real time using as much
information as possible.
</p>

<p>
I noticed Whisper by open AI  only takes into consideration audio to do do its
transcriptions. What if we also used other information present in the video to
improve the accuracy of our transcription.

<a href="language helper .html">My Real goal</a>
</p>

<p>
I want a tool that works with any video source in real time and can provide
accurate 
</p>


<div id="Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-Analyze video screen shots for context"><h2 id="Analyze video screen shots for context" class="header"><a href="#Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-Analyze video screen shots for context">Analyze video screen shots for context</a></h2></div>
<p>
Use object recognition to analyze the screenshot to understand the current
setting of the video which can provide relevant contextuals clues about
what words are most likely. For example, suppose the video takes place in
a kitchen and it identifies a glass. Even if the speaker at some point
slurs the word glass so it sounds more like 'klass', given that we take
the objects in the room into consideration, we can realize that they most
likely said 'glass'. I believe this is called <a href="topic modeling.html">topic modeling</a>

<div id="Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-Soft subs"><h2 id="Soft subs" class="header"><a href="#Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-Soft subs">Soft subs</a></h2></div>
<p>
If soft subs exist you can use them to inform the model. They should generally
be accurate as to the meaning of the speaker. But they are not assumed to be
correct. Use them to improve accuracy for cases such as 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
speaker's speech is completly different than the sub but meaning is the same

<li>
speech and sub similar but not exactly the same.

<li>
almost exactly the same but there are errors. 

</ul>
  
<div id="Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-Audio"><h2 id="Audio" class="header"><a href="#Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-Audio">Audio</a></h2></div>
<p>
Using Whisper we can transcribe the audio for a sentence. 
</p>


<div id="Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-What if hard coded subs exist"><h2 id="What if hard coded subs exist" class="header"><a href="#Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-What if hard coded subs exist">What if hard coded subs exist</a></h2></div>
<p>
when subtitles exist but they are hard coded we can OCR the screen shot.
Whatever text appears in that line has a good chance of being correct so
we at that point would just be validating it using our other sources such
as audio and screen shots.
</p>

<p>
why so much confidence? I have noticed hard subs tend to exactly match what the
speaker said. They were most likely human made.
</p>

<div id="Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-Video agnostic"><h2 id="Video agnostic" class="header"><a href="#Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-Video agnostic">Video agnostic</a></h2></div>
<p>
you can use this tool wherever there is a video and audio stream
</p>


<div id="Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-How do you know if you should be analying"><h2 id="How do you know if you should be analying" class="header"><a href="#Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-How do you know if you should be analying">How do you know if you should be analying</a></h2></div>
<p>
we need a way to determine quickly if the current portion of the video has any
audio
</p>

<div id="Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-How do you know if you should be analying-Make the user deal with it"><h3 id="Make the user deal with it" class="header"><a href="#Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-How do you know if you should be analying-Make the user deal with it">Make the user deal with it</a></h3></div>
<p>
not crazy about this soulution but we could just make the user set starrt and
end point and have the video analyze that portion only
</p>

<div id="Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-Auto detect speech"><h2 id="Auto detect speech" class="header"><a href="#Realtime contextual video subtitle transcriber-Auto detect speech">Auto detect speech</a></h2></div>
<p>
the model can quickly detect is someonce talking. if so, it can automatically
analyze. yeah sounds great but probably difficuctl in practice
