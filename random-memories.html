<div id="Random Memories"><h1 id="Random Memories" class="header"><a href="#Random Memories">Random Memories</a></h1></div>
<p>
I hope that by writting down these memories I can let some of them go. I am
pestered by them usually following some prompt.

<div id="Random Memories-Coffee &amp; Milk"><h2 id="Coffee &amp; Milk" class="header"><a href="#Random Memories-Coffee &amp; Milk">Coffee &amp; Milk</a></h2></div>
<p>
In a class on basic logic the teacher talked about inclusive or. \(P \lor Q\)
He mentioned something along the lines of different ways that are sufficent for
your coffee to be mixed. P=you stirred it with a spoon Q=you poured milk in
before you poured in the coffee. If either or both were true then the whole
statement of your coffee being mixed would be true. Every time I mix coffee with
milk I am haunted by this random memory.

<div id="Random Memories-Tuesday/Thursday Confusion"><h2 id="Tuesday/Thursday Confusion" class="header"><a href="#Random Memories-Tuesday/Thursday Confusion">Tuesday/Thursday Confusion</a></h2></div>
<p>
An embarassing memory from that same logic class was when I asked the dumbest
question of my life. The teacher showed the calendar days on the slide as
</p>

<p>
M,T,W,T,F,S,S
</p>

<p>
And despite already knowing the answer I raised my hand and asked what the
second 'T' stood for. I'm not sure what my intention was behind this question.
