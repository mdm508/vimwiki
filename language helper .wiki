= Language helper =
I love learning languages from videos...but i am dissatisfied with the available
tools on the market. 

== Whats your real goal? ==
Well the only reason I want a tool like [[idea_trans_subs | transcribe substitles]] is because I am tired of the
limitations of tools like migaku or language reactor  where you need soft subs to [[sentence_mining|sentence mine]]
Such tools are also limited to specific platforms like youtube or netflix. You
need to write plugins for any video source. 

Besides that, the subs often don't match what the speaker is saying, which can
be difficult if your new to the language.

I'd love it if you could 
a) accurately match what the speaker was saying
b) for any video that you can run on your computer
c) have ai give explanations and suggestions based on the entire context of what
   it has learned from the video.

== Real time rather than all at once ==
I want to have a tool thats use as needed. Each translation will also be
expensive in terms of the AI analyzing it. This might be okay for learners who
plan to spend a long time reading a single subtitle anyway. 

== Windows ==
How much of the video should the AI take into consideration when providing
suggestions?
