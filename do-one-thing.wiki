In meditation I am told to choose a topic and stay with it. That topic is
usually the breath.

But, I think this practice of choosing a topic treating all other thoughts as
noise can be applied to daily life.

I have a tendency to want to do multiple activities at the same time. I want to
see what it would be like to try just doing 1 thing. Don't look back and don't
look far ahead. Just the 1 thing.
